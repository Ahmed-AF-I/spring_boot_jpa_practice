# 🚀 Employee Management System (JPA Relationship Lab)

A robust Spring Boot application designed to master advanced JPA Entity Relationships, Data Mapping, and Filtering Specifications.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Advanced Concepts

- **Java 25** & **Spring Boot 4.0.5**
- **Spring Data JPA** (Hibernate)
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Lombok** (Boilerplate reduction)
- **Jakarta Validation** (Input Sanitization)

## 🧩 Key Features & Patterns Implemented

- **Entity Relationships**: Deep dive into `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, and `@ManyToMany` (Employee-Mission)
- **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**: Using Java Records for immutable and clean data transfer
- **Structural Mapping**: Manual Mappers for full control over Entity-DTO conversion, preventing circular references
- **Advanced Filtering**: Implementation of JPA Specifications for dynamic, complex searching (firstName, lastName, email)
- **Clean Controller Design**: Full RESTful CRUD operations with appropriate HTTP status codes

## 🗺️ Database Architecture

- **Employee ↔ Address**: Unidirectional One-to-One
- **Department ↔ Employee**: Bidirectional One-to-Many
- **Employee ↔ Mission**: Bidirectional Many-to-Many with a custom JoinTable

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Address Endpoints (`/api/address`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/address/search` | Search addresses using `street`, `houseNumber`, or `zipCode` query parameters |
| `GET` | `/api/address/{id}` | Retrieve a specific address by ID |
| `PUT` | `/api/address/{id}` | Update an existing address |
| `DELETE` | `/api/address/{id}` | Delete an address |

> ⚠️ **Note**: The create method in `AddressController` is missing a `@PostMapping` annotation, so it is currently not exposed as an endpoint.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 25 or higher
- PostgreSQL database
- Maven or Gradle (depending on your build tool)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd employee-management-system
```

2. Configure PostgreSQL database in `application.properties` or `application.yml`:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```

3. Build the project:
```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`
